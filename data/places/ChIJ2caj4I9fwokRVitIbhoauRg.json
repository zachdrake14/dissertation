But as for the case manager ive had very undermining disrespectful ... Judgemental and just plan rude ... He made me feel ashamed that there was mice as if it was my fault whrn the entire building is infested ... He made a big deal over me washing my clothing in the bathtubs and hanging it to dry ... Mind u this is a family shelter its my husband myself and my 18 month old son all sharing one room and bathroom ( its a hotel room). We have zero storage for our clothing besides the small closet no dressers or small drawers there for we keep our clothes folded in suitcases or on top the desk ... My son can't sleep in the crib becuz the mice go scurrying thru it at night leaving droppings everywhere an exterminator has come twice ... Ive caught about 8 mice all together .. We only have a bunk bed with a single matters neither of us wants to sleep on top so we take down the mattresses and put it together on the floor which is technically n not allowed either but I well. We have been there going on 7 n half months ... Still waiting ...only just met the housing specialist ... There are families who have spent 3 or more years in this place which is just rediculous.  Also the elevator has been broken for I believe 2 months or more so I have to lug my son upstairs and a stroller plus w.e groceries act I have all while I'm pregnant .. SMDH .. Any ways thats my experience",

It was a place to call home, before getting an apartment.  Hang in there people it gets better I promise, GOOD LUCK TO ALL U FAMILIES DONT BE AFARID TO ASK FOR A HELPING HAND THATS WHAT THEY ARE THERE FOR. You dont know if a worker was a guest in there just like you. They could have had a room there 35 yrs ago.",
